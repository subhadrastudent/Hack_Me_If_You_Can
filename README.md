Project Title: Automated Network Reconnaissance using Nmap and Bash 
Project Overview 
This project is focused on automating network scanning tasks using Nmap (Network 
Mapper) and Bash scripting on Linux. The goal is to help beginners understand how 
cybersecurity professionals gather information about computer networks, identify potential 
vulnerabilities, and create a basic automated tool. 
Objective 
Understand basic Nmap usage for scanning networks. 
Learn to write Bash scripts to automate common scanning operations. 
Develop a beginner-friendly tool that: 
Accepts a target IP range or domain. 
Performs basic scans (ping, port, OS detection). 
Saves output in organized files. 
Host the completed tool and documentation on GitHub. 
Tools & Technologies Used 
Nmap: For network and vulnerability scanning. 
Bash (Linux Shell Scripting): To automate the tasks. 
GitHub: For version control and public project hosting. 
Folder Structure 
nmap-bash-scanner/ 
├── README.md 
├── scan.sh 
├── results/ 
│   └── [targetname]_scan.txt 
└── LICENSE 
How It Works 
1. User runs scan.sh and inputs a target IP or domain. 
2. Script runs the following: 
Ping scan to check if the host is up. 
Port scan to find open ports. 
OS detection and service version detection. 
3. All outputs are saved in a text file inside the results/ folder. 
Sample Bash Script (scan.sh) 
#!/bin/bash 
echo "Welcome to Simple Nmap Bash Scanner" 
read -p "Enter the target IP or domain: " target 
filename="results/${target}_scan.txt" 
mkdir -p results 
echo "Scanning host: $target" 
echo "Results will be saved in $filename" 
# Ping Scan 
echo "Running Ping Scan..." | tee -a $filename 
nmap -sn $target | tee -a $filename 
# Port Scan 
echo -e "\nRunning Port Scan..." | tee -a $filename 
nmap -p- $target | tee -a $filename 
# OS Detection 
echo -e "\nRunning OS Detection and Service Version Scan..." | tee -a $filename 
nmap -A $target | tee -a $filename 
echo -e "\nScan completed. Check the file: $filename"
